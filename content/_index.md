We are a group of community volunteers, working together to
better prepare Prosser-Lakeview against the threat of wildfire.

The group's goals are to

- Reduce the risk of wildfire in our community.
- Educate ourselves on risk reduction and evacuations.
- Reduce fuel and harden homes against wildfires.
- Coordinate with our fire protection officials.
