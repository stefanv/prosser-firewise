We are a group of community volunteers, working together to
better prepare Prosser-Lakeview against the threat of wildfire.

The group's goals are to

- Equip homeowners to protect their properties against wildfire;
- identify fire hazards;
- educate;
- assist the fire department to improve neighborhood fire safety.
