We are a group of community volunteers, working together to
better prepare Prosser against the threat of wildfire.

The group's goals are to

- Educate ourselves on risk reduction and evacuations.
- Work together as a community to mitigate the risk of wildfire in our Prosser subdivisions.
- Reduce fuel and harden homes against wildfires.
- Coordinate with local fire protection agencies to help achieve our goals.
