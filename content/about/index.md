title: About
---

We started Prosser Firewise because everyone in the
‘hood is concerned about similar things: Will my house survive a
wildfire in the neighborhood? Will my homeowner's insurance rates
skyrocket next year (or will I get dropped by my insurance after
years)? Are there resources available to help clean up undeveloped
lots and open space that's become overgrown and hazardous?

We're joining other Truckee neighborhoods like Tahoe Donner and
Glenshire/Devonshire in being recognized by the National
Fire Protection Association® as a certified Firewise
Community. Benefits include: better protection of our homes, property,
family, and neighbors from wildfire; safeguarding our forest,
wildlife, and watershed; making evacuations safer; and potentially
reducing insurance premiums. (California FAIR Plan, USAA, and Mercury
insurance plans.)

Getting involved is as easy as spending one hour a year doing yard cleanup!
