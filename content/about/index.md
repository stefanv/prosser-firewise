We started Prosser Firewise because everyone in the ‘hood is concerned about similar things:
Will my house survive a wildfire in the neighborhood?
Will my homeowner's insurance rates skyrocket next year?
Will I get dropped by my insurance?
Are there resources available to help clean up undeveloped lots and open space that’s become overgrown and hazardous?

We have joined other Truckee neighborhoods like Tahoe Donner and
Glenshire/Devonshire in being recognized by the National Fire Protection
Association® as a Firewise Community.

Benefits include:

- better protection of our homes, property, family, and neighbors from
wildfire;
- safeguarding our forest, wildlife, and watershed; making
evacuations safer; and
- potentially reducing insurance premiums (see [insurers currently offering discounts](https://www.insurance.ca.gov/01-consumers/105-type/95-guides/03-res/Insurers-Currently-Offering-Discounts.cfm)).

As with Truckee’s existing firewise communities, the success of the
Prosser Firewise Community depends on the voluntary involvement of our
homeowners and residents. Getting involved is as easy as spending one
hour a year doing yard cleanup and recording the time you invested on
the [Prosser Firewise Risk Reduction Form]({{< link "log" >}}).
