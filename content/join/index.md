title: About
---

We started Prosser Firewise because everyone in the ‘hood is concerned
about similar things: Will my house survive a wildfire in the
neighborhood? Will my homeowner’s insurance rates skyrocket next year
(or will I get dropped by my insurance after years)? Are there
resources available to help clean up undeveloped lots and open space
that’s become overgrown and hazardous?

We’re joining other Truckee neighborhoods like Tahoe Donner and
Glenshire/Devonshire in being recognized by the National Fire
Protection Association® as a Firewise Community.

Benefits include:

- better protection of our homes, property, family, and neighbors from
wildfire;
- safeguarding our forest, wildlife, and watershed; making
evacuations safer; and
- potentially reducing insurance premiums (California FAIR Plan, USAA, and Mercury insurance plans).

As with Truckee’s existing firewise communities, the success of the
Prosser Firewise Community depends on the voluntary involvement of our
homeowners and residents. Getting involved is as easy as spending one
hour a year doing yard cleanup and recording the time you invested on
the [Prosser Firewise Risk Reduction Form](https://forms.gle/91CGZHuW7Pwp2G5m9).
